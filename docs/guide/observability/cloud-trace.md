# Agent Telemetry Events (Cloud Trace)

## Overview

All agent templates generated by the Agent Starter Pack are automatically instrumented with OpenTelemetry. This provides detailed tracing and span data for agent operations, which are exported to **Google Cloud Trace**.

**Key Features:**

*   **Always Enabled:** This telemetry is active by default in all environments, including local development (`make playground`) and all Terraform-deployed environments (dev, staging, prod).
*   **Distributed Tracing:** Track requests and operations as they flow through different parts of your agent, including LLM calls and tool executions.
*   **Latency Analysis:** Identify performance bottlenecks by analyzing the duration of individual spans.
*   **Error Visibility:** Traces capture errors, helping to pinpoint where failures occur.
*   **No Configuration Required:** Works out-of-the-box.

## How It Works

The ADK framework and underlying libraries emit OpenTelemetry spans for significant operations. These spans are collected and sent to your Google Cloud project's Cloud Trace service.

You can view traces in the Google Cloud Console by navigating to **Trace > Trace explorer**.

This provides valuable insights into the agent's internal workings without requiring any specific log-parsing setup.
